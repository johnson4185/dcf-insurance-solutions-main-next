## ❓ Common Questions

### Why can't Copilot create the repository?
Security constraints prevent Copilot from creating new GitHub repositories. It can only prepare files and instructions.

### What is "dcfmob"?
Based on the name:
- DCF = DCF Insurance Solutions
- MOB = Mobile (likely)

It appears to be a mobile-focused variant of this application.

### Do I need all these files?
No! Pick one documentation file based on your preference:
- **Fast:** Use QUICKSTART_DCFMOB.md
- **Detailed:** Use COPY_TO_DCFMOB.md
- **Automated:** Use setup-dcfmob.sh

The template files are optional but make configuration easier.

### Can I customize dcfmob?
Yes! After creating the repository, you can:
- Modify the code for mobile-specific features
- Change branding and styling
- Add/remove features
- Deploy to your preferred platform
