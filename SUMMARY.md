## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Why Can't Copilot Create the Repository?
For security reasons, the Copilot agent:
- Cannot create new GitHub repositories
- Cannot push to repositories it doesn't have access to
- Can only modify files in the current repository

### What Copilot DID Do
- Created all necessary template files
- Pre-configured everything for dcfmob
- Wrote detailed instructions (3 different methods)
- Made the process as easy as possible for you

## 💡 Understanding "dcfmob"
Based on the name:
- "dcf" = DCF Insurance Solutions
- "mob" = Mobile (likely)

The template files are configured for a mobile-focused variant, but you can customize them for any purpose.

## 🔧 Customization
After creating dcfmob, you can:
1. Add mobile-specific features
2. Remove desktop-only components
3. Optimize for mobile performance
4. Update branding and styling
5. Deploy to mobile-optimized hosting

## 📞 Need Help?
1. Start with `QUICKSTART_DCFMOB.md` (easiest)
2. Check `COPY_TO_DCFMOB.md` for alternatives
3. Run `./setup-dcfmob.sh` for interactive setup
4. All template files are ready to use

## ✅ What's Been Tested
